This is our Hilo Game contained in the Program.cs file.

This game "draws" a randomly generated card and asks the user to guess if the next drawn card will have a higher or lower value. The user starts with 300 points, and if they guess correctly, 100 points are added to their score. If they guess incorrectly, 75 points are subtracted. After each guess, the user is able to decide if they want to continue the game. The game ends if the user chooses to quit, the points hit 0 or below, or if the deck runs out of cards.

The main game is inside Program.cs. Classes referenced inside the game are in separate files with the same name: Deck.cs, Scoreboard.cs, and Card.cs.

Required software: Visual Studio Code, C# extension
